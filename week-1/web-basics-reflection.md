## 5. Web Basics Assignment and Reflection

##Part 1: Based on the resources you looked at, describe the terms you learned about.

- Browser: software on your local computer that displays websites
- DNS: Domain name server, mechanism for converting textual web address (www.cnn.com) to IP address
- Domain: 
- Internet:  The "wire" that carries digital traffic of all sorts
- IP address: The unique numeric code for a given "place" on the internet, may be a single computer, a bank of servers, my thermostat, anything.
- Web app: More than a mere website, provides interactive content on a website
- Web server: any computer that provides files to browsers at the other end to display a website
- Website: A page or pages under a web address that shows content. At its most simple, written in HTML.
- World wide web: All the websites one can reach through the internet


Explain how the internet displays your website after you push your changes.Someone else types in www.jonclayton.com
If their computer hasn't been to that website recently, it queries a set of nameservers to find the authoritative server for that domain name, and retrieves the right IP address for my website
Their computer sends a request to my website's IP address requesting the files needed to display the website, and routers in the internet are smart enough for that request to come to my webserver. It send the files back in similar fashion

## Part 2: Reflection
- What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
I did not know the hierarchy of DNS servers, and I didn't understand the hassle and delays of moving websites especially if your nameserver changes.
- How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
Didn't do this
- Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Sure....the second counts for refreshing DNS information clarify why there's a delay.
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Nope.
