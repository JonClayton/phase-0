#Think About Time Reflection
Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
How do you manage your time currently?
Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I actually read through all the links.  The one I dug into most was Tiny Habits, and I'm actually doing BJ Fogg's one week "course" in Tiny Habits next week.  

Time Boxing is the notion of setting a specific time limit for a task and at the end of it stopping and assessing progress.  This is what we're asked to do by limiting the time we spend on some activities like this one---which I didn't really do because I'm not going to feel any time constraints during Phase0--I have plenty of extra time.

The counterintuitive productivity piece hit a little close to home because I can be an epic procrastinator with things that I don't have enthusiasm for.  Hence my new career path, and my current strategy really is to ruthlessly eliminate having to do so many things that aren't fun/interesting/etc.  

Of the topics here, I'm already trying to put into action the Tiny Habits concept, and I know we'll be doing meditation onsite, though I will try to have some more quiet time before then too.  I take long walks where I'm usually listening to podcasts, but I'll add in some quiet reflective time in them.

My overall plan for time management in Phase 0 is actually to put in lots of "extra credit" time, since I have it available and the curriculum does give us lots of optional material.  For example I'll probably work through the "Ruby the Hard Way" course, though it sure sounds like I won't like it as much as I have RubyMonk, which I think is hilarious and effective.
