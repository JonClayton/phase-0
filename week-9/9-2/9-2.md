Sorry for choosing a pretty simple exercise, but time is of the essence!

[Here's a link to the JS file](https://github.com/JonClayton/phase-0/blob/master/week-9/9-2/review.js)
```javascript
function isFibonacci(num) {
  var fib1 = 0;
  var fib2 = 1;
  while (num>fib2) {
    var fibNext=fib1+fib2;
    fib1=fib2;
    fib2=fibNext;
  }
  return fib2==num;
}

console.log(isFibonacci(7));
console.log(isFibonacci(8));
console.log(isFibonacci(9));
```
###Reflections
####What concepts did you solidify in working on this challenge? 
The fewer methods/functions you use in an algorithm, the easier it will be to translate between languages. Loops and variables are lingua franca.

####What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
As always, remembering syntax when changing langauges. I got an error right away until I remembered to start a function definition with `function` rather than  `def`

####Did you solve the problem in a new way this time?
The first time I did it in Ruby I used an array.  This time I went straight to the variables for the most recent two terms in the sequence.

####Was your pseudocode different from the Ruby version? What was the same and what was different?
Umm...psuedocode?  ;-)
