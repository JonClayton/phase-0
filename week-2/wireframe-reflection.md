#What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a sketch of what the webpage's basic structure will look like.  It has labels for different shapes and features, but no text, formatting, photos, background or other features.

#What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing forces you to think through what's going to go on each page, how you'd like to fit it togethers, and a rudimentary look and feel, at least at the level of shapes and locations. It's easy to fiddle with in wireframe form, and if done well, the wireframe provides a good map for coding the HTML and CSS needed to generate a good looking page.

#Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes, althought I think I would prefer to wireframe a single page and then work a bit more on it, because some of the wireframe carries over to the other pages and I'd want to get that common theme a little "more right" before rolling it into the other pages.

#Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
So far, so good.  I'm sure I'll change it when I start formatting!


#What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
-What program should I use instead of pencil and paper. I found my answer on the Slack channel, with the suggestion of Pencil as a free program.

#Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I liked using the software to make the wireframes. I liked thinking about the structure of the page. I'm getting better at Markdown, so putting this file together is less tedious than in prior challenges.
