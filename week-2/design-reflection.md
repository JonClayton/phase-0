#What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
This comes from the article by [six phases](http://www.idesignstudios.com/blog/web-design/phases-web-design-development-process/#.Vht0MRNVikp "Selene Bowlby").
- Information Gathering: we did this for our site by collecting links and the like
- Planning: we did this for our site by building a simple site map
- Design: this is look and feel of the website, which I will find a challenge!
- Development: this is the actual building of the website following the architectural and design specifications already created
- Testing and Delivery: this is making sure the website works as intended and handing it off to the owner
- Maintenance: this is ongoing work on the website, including adding new content

#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
At the moment my site is to let people get to know me by providing information about me. I expect over time it wiil include, or link to, more professional content and some of the "fun" content will disappear or be harder to find.

#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience is at the moment my DBC peers and faculty, who will use this website to get to know me. I hope to address them by making it interesting and attractive enough that they want to click around and find out more, getting to know me better.

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different #ons for different kinds of visitors.
I want them to click around, looking for information and I hope stumbling over things they were not looking for but will find interesting.

#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Design and user experience are not something you can successfully just copy from some website you like. Design is somewhat subjective, though many elements of it have recognized principles, such as using colors that are known to work well together and not overwhelming the user with too many differences in font type and size. User experience is, in a way, even more subjective, since it's not about clicks or stickiness so much as how the user feels while using the website. Yet it is also subject to some scientific investigation through tools like A/B testing where alternative UE choices are compared and users interviewed to see which choice generates a better experience.

#What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

Per [Smashing Mag](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/what-is-user-experience-design-overview-tools-and-resources/ "Jacob Gube") UX design is aimed at understanding and improving how users feel about a system, with some of the topics being:
- ease of use
- perception of value
- utility
- efficiency

UX design is valuable because it is focused on much of what makes a website or system successful. A website that does not provide a good user experience will have a much harder time persuading users to return. In fact, it would need to be essentially unique, since a user who suffers a poor experience will almost surely try to find an alternative that provides the same functionality with a better experience.


#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Trying to figure out how to display the photo in Markdown is a pain. Why not just use HTML? I used WriteMaps for the site map, which was fun and easy. I found the linked articles interesting enough that they were not tedious.  This reflection was a little tedious because I'm still learning Markdown.
