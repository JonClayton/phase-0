<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I'm glad to be finally doing it.  The CodeAcademy lessons seemed pretty artificial and led me by the nose.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
The notion of being very rigorous about HTML being semantic only and all formatting in CSS appeals to the rule-follower in me.  I thought it was pretty easy to look up HTML5 elements, and it definitely paid to do a little homework in advance of the pair session

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
It's tempting.....especially with one-off things like where an image should go.  It seems like CSS will be a lot of work when you're giving an image a unique classifier to center it rather than just doing it in HTML, but I understand that you want the HTML itself to be context indepenent and leave all the context to browser/device specific CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Almost everything bad about HTML is at least partially alleviated by the wonders of SublimeText.  The pain of surrounding elements with tags is much less with all the automatic things Subl does for us.  The downside to me is that I am used to WYSIWYG, so it is annoying to have to switch back and forth to see if things are working.  I wish there was some way that Subl would be autosaving.....

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
None yet.  I will need to make some flash cards I think.
